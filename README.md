### Dappos Remix Plugin

Dappos is a frontend interface builder for smart contracts. It allows you to build dapps on the fly without frontend code.
Dappos supports smart contracts built with the solidity programming language and can therefore be used with any of the EVM compatible networks (Ethereum, Binance, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom etc.)

Although progamming experience with solidity is helpful, it's not required. Anyone that has used blockchain explorers like Etherscan to interact with smart contracts will find the process of building a dapp with Dappos very intuitive.

The remix ide plugin allows you to create dapp frontend interfaces for smart contracts deployed with the remix ide.
